Greetings. I'm Kayce. Welcome to my little home on the good ol' World Wide Web.

Currently I'm reading a lot. I'm also quite engaged in my work right now, which to be honest
isn't always the case.

I work for Google as a technical writer. For 3 years I primarily wrote most of the docs for
Chrome DevTools, and also dabbled in videos. I also wrote a lot of the Lighthouse docs. These
days I manage the Web DevRel technical writer team. I'm also "content lead" for
[web.dev](https://web.dev), meaning that I'm responsible for setting a
direction for the site's content and making sure that all of our content aligns with that
direction.

I write here and there on [my blog](/blog/) about whatever topics strike my fancy. I mostly write
about technical writing.

Here are some of my other profiles across the web:
