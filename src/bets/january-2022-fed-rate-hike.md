* 0% chance the rate will be lower
* 93% chance the rate will be the same
* 7% chance the rate will be higher

Jim Bianco put out a [thread](https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1452808415894556679)
with some links to tools that supposedly show how the market is
pricing in hikes. The [CME tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html)
puts the odds at 7%. I'm updating my forecast accordingly to account
for the small possibility.

* 0% chance the rate will be lower
* 100% chance the rate will be same
* 0% chance the rate will be higher

The Fed moves slowly and broadcasts its moves well in advance. Their
"transitory inflation" narrative is not facing a unified attack. We
would need to see a severe shock or months of sustained inflation
across many, many politically sensitive areas in order for the Fed
to move higher. They also will not move lower because negative rates
for the world's reserve currency would be a very controversial move
that could cause a lot of disorder in markets. Barring a severe shock
(e.g. February 2020) if the Fed was going to move higher or lower,
they would have made it very clear by now.
