## Background

[market]: https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7363

PredictIt has a [betting market][market] for the following question:

> Will marijuana be rescheduled under the Controlled Substances Act by April 20?

The market resolves to `Yes` in the event that marijuana is removed
from the Schedule I list before 21 April 2022.

## Updates

<h3 id="2021-november-29">2021 November 29</h3>

I placed a $100 `Yes` bet on PredictIt at $0.10 per share.
The order hasn't completely filled yet. I have bought 542 shares
($54.20 total cost) and am waiting for someone to sell me
the remaining 458 shares.

I don't believe this event will actually happen per se.
Rather, I think the market has mispriced the odds. It's
currently at 10% whereas I think there's more of a 30-50% chance
of this happening. This bet is an exercise is probabilistic
thinking.

I'm not sure if I'll see this one to its end date. If I can sell
these shares at a profit before the end date I may go for it.
