## Last week

On Friday Gabi and I got the ingredients for guacamole, made
said guacamole, and spent Christmas Eve at my mom's home with
my family. On Saturday we lounged around some more at my mom's.
On Sunday we started dogsitting a dog named Cheese for a week.
It was a bit stressful at first but we're enjoying it now. 
On Monday night I decided to try a 24-hour fast. I didn't quite
make it to 24 hours. It was more like 20 hours. Nonetheless it
was an interesting experience! Throughout the week I continued
learning Flutter development and continued setting up the wedding.
