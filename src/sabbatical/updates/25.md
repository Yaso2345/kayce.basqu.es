## Last week

On Friday I did chores (e.g. going to the bank) and routine tasks (e.g.
exercising). I have been listening to 2 podcasts: *Uptime Wind Energy
Podcast* and *The Market Huddle*. On Saturday we had a family photo.
A lot of people showed up and it was wonderful seeing everyone again.
On Sunday Gabi and I made a caesar salad (homemade vegan dressing of course)
and went to a Friendsgiving.
