## Reading

I continued reading [*Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos Or Community?*][mlk].

## Last week

On Friday and Saturday I went into a rabbit hole writing a Python script
that helps me identify long volatilty trades. On Sunday Gabi and I watched
Dune (the new movie) with a couple friends. It was amazing! Gabi and I are
now reading the book together. We'll probably see the movie in theaters
again. On Monday I reflected on Dune and secured a date for our wedding
ceremony. On Tuesday I worked on one of my technical writing projects.
I'll call it the template project. I am making a template website that
is optimized for technical documentation. I will be using this template
website as the starting point for future projects.

## What's next
