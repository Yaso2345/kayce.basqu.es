## Reading

I started reading *Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World* by Paul Stamets.

[psilocybin]: https://fungi.com/products/psilocybin-mushrooms-of-the-world

## Last week

Friday was New Year's Eve. Gabi and I took a long walk through Golden
Gate Park with the dog we're watching. We made tacos and rung in the new
year at home. Saturday I continued learning Flutter development. I am
getting back into the habit of setting and following a schedule.

## What's next
