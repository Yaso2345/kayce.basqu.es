## Last week

[resdogs]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_Dogs
[sexed]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Education_(TV_series)

From Friday to Monday Gabi and I dogsat/housesat for my cousin in Burlingame.
We binge-watched [*Reservation Dogs*][resdogs] and [*Sex Education*][sexed],
cooked a few nice meals, and took the dogs on some pleasant walks around
the neighborhood. On Tuesday I did some wedding planning. I am interested
in markets again and it's hard to pull away from *Geopolitical Alpha* and
*The Market Huddle*.
