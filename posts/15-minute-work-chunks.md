  If you're feeling overwhelmed, try hacking away at each task for 15 minutes. No more, no less.

Today I was briefly overwhelmed with option paralysis. I have a lot of
projects to kick off, but I couldn't decide which one to work
on. Instead, I decided to hack away at each one for 15-minutes. It
was quite nice. It built up my self-esteem a little because I felt like I was
taking *some* action towards each project. And I also enjoyed the variety. I
extended this experiment to routine tasks, such as replying to emails and
monitoring community channels. That was also satisfying, because it put a
finite limit on how much time I'd spend on those tasks.
