# 15-Minute Work Chunks

<time datetime="2018-04-04">2018 April 4</time>

Today I was briefly overwhelmed with option paralysis. I have a lot of
projects to kick off, but I couldn't decide which one to work
on. Instead, I decided to hack away at each one for 15-minutes. It
was quite nice. It built up my self-esteem a little because I felt like I was
taking *some* action towards each project. And I also enjoyed the variety.
