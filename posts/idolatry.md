# Idolatry

<time datetime="2018-03-28">2018 March 28</time>

I'm reading a fascinating critique on capitalism by the psychologist Erich
Fromm. I first discovered Fromm via his other book, *The Art Of Love*. It's
an enlightening perspective on what it means exactly to "love", and I highly
recommend it. I feel much more capable of creating fulfilling relationships
because of that book.

In *The Sane Society*, Fromm argues that idolatry is alive and well. Yes,
we're talking about biblical idolatry. You probably know the story about the
Israelites who created the golden calf during Moses's absence, and started
worshipping it. I never paid much mind to that story up until now. I'd just
say to myself "silly Israelites" and shrug it off. I also had a tendency to
only narrowly apply the concept to religious matters.

But Fromm argues that idolatry permeates modern society. Humanity built
capitalism, yet now we worship capitalism as a force greater than humanity.
The path forward is to reclaim our power and responsibility over society.
We are not cogs in the great machine of society. We are the masters of
society.

Fromm goes on to define a purpose for society (which includes government)
that I quite like. He says that its purpose is to help each and every one of
us live out fulfilling lives. I like this a lot because it gives me a
framework to determine society's priorities. Society should be structured
around giving us the freedom to live out a fulfilling life, however we see it.

The key is to apply this principle universally. I can live out a fulfilling
life however I see fit, as long as it doesn't impede your ability to live out
a fulfilling life however you see fit.
