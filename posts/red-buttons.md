Red buttons will lead to more responses than blue ones.

## Experiment

50% of readers saw a [red version of the feedback widget][red].

The color of the buttons was the only difference between the 2 versions of the doc.

## Interpretation

* This experiment only proves that red buttons get more responses than blue buttons. It does not
  prove that red buttons get more responses than any other color.
* One of my fellow technical writers at Google suggested that the color of the buttons might
  influence how users respond. For example, perhaps users find blue to be a more aesthetically-pleasing
  color, and are therefore more likely to be subconsciously nudged into responding that the doc was
  helpful than they would if the button was some other color. The data from this experiment seems to
  disprove this hypothesis. The *Avg. Value* column in Figure X represents how users responded. In both
  the red and blue cases, 61 out of 100 users said that the doc was helpful.
