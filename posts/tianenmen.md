# Me and Tianenmen

I was born on June 4, 1989. The very same day that Chinese government representatives
murdered thousands of their own citizens at Tianenmen Square.

I sometimes hear stories about people waking up in the middle of the night and walking outside,
only to discover that their neighbors had also inexpicably woken up and walked outside. The next
day they find out that some major massacre had occurred, such as the atomic bombings at
Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

I believe those stories. I believe that our psychic connections run way deeper than modern
science understands. As an experiment, try sitting perfectly still and then watch a stranger
that's walking by. Watch them intently. Put a lot of focus and energy into your watching.
Every now and then, they'll turn their head exactly to where you are. They don't look around
in different directions, trying to find you. They're head turns exactly to where you are.

In light of this, I often wonder about what kind of impact Tianenmen subconsciously had on
my psyche.

I believe that Tianenmen Square subconsciously affected my psyche.
