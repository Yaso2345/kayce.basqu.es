# Humanism

<time datetime="2018-03-21">2018 March 21</time>

I'm currently on a flight back from my first trip to Paris. I was there for about 2 weeks.
I thought a lot about society, and read 2 books:

* *The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction* by William Doyle
* *The Sane Society* by Erich Fromm

It was surreal to walk around the very places where pivotal events of the French Revolution
took place over 200 years ago.

The main idea I'm taking away from *The Sane Society* is this: society (which includes government)
only exists to help each and every one of us, as individual humans, live out fulfilling lives.
The purpose of society is to provide the conditions for our physical, spiritual, intellectual,
and social wellbeing. This is a political orientation that I can stand behind.
