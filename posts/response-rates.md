# Technical Writer Metrics: Improving Response Rates

<time datetime="2018-05-08">2018 May 8</time>

<p id="summary">
  This is my lightning talk from the Write The Docs 2018 conference in Portland. Using the
  scientific method appears to be helping me improve response rates in "was this page
  helpful?" feedback widgets. If you want to join me in building a little community
  dedicated to figuring out how to apply metrics to technical writing, then email me at
  <code>kayce@basqu.es</code> or tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/kaycebasques">@kaycebasques</a>.

On a whim, I decided to give a lightning talk on day 2 of the 2018 Write The Docs conference
in Portland. A lightning talk is an informal, 5-minute talk on anything related to the
conference. Time permitting, pretty much any attendee can come up on stage and talk.

The main takeaway: if you want to join me on this voyage to learn metrics, then email me
at `kayce@basqu.es` or tweet me at [@kaycebasques](https://twitter.com/kaycebasques).
