# Technical Writer Metrics: Improving Response Rates (Write The Docs 2018 Lightning Talk)

<time datetime="2018-05-08">2018 May 8</time>

<p id="summary">
  My lightning talk from the Write The Docs 2018 conference in Portland. I talk about my
  attempts to use the scientific method to improve response rates in feedback widgets.

On a whim, I decided to give a talk on day 2 of the Write The Docs 2018 North America
conference in Portland. My goal is to build a little community of like-minded folks who
might not "get" metrics but want to figure it out. So, if that sounds like you, send me
a message!
